# MNIST Digit Classifier data. 

The problem is solved by two techniques

1. Simple Classification Techniques.
2. CNN Keras Model

### Simple Classification Models:
* Basic classificatin models were applied.
* Variations of Naive Bayes Algorithm, Decision tree bossting XGBoost algorithm were applied.
* Maximum Accuracy obtained was : 97.29% of the XGBoost Classifier

### CNN Keras Sequential Model:
* A sequential Convulational Neural Network was designed using Keras and TensorFlow.
* Base accuracy on validation data set obtained was 98.25 %
* With error prediction and loss graphs the error can be yet minimized by tweaking the model.
